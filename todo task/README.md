# About app

This application is a todo list manager that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter todo items based on their status. Here's an overview of its functionality:

Add Todo: Users can input a name and description for a todo item and add it to the list by clicking the "Add Todo" button.

Edit Todo: Each todo item in the list can be edited by clicking the "Edit" button. This allows users to modify the name and description of the todo item.

Save and Cancel Edits: After editing a todo item, users can choose to save their changes or cancel them by clicking the respective buttons.

Delete Todo: Users can remove a todo item from the list by clicking the "Delete" button associated with that item.

Filter Todos: The status of each todo item can be toggled between "Completed" and "Not Completed" using a dropdown menu. Users can filter the todo list to display only items with a specific status or view all items.

Status Change: When a todo item's status is changed from "Not Completed" to "Completed" (or vice versa) using the dropdown menu, the list of todos is updated accordingly to reflect the change.

Visual Feedback: The application provides visual feedback to users through Bootstrap-styled components such as buttons, dropdown menus, and cards. Completed todo items are visually distinguished from those that are not yet completed.

Overall, this todo list manager offers a user-friendly interface for organizing and managing tasks, with intuitive features for adding, editing, deleting, and filtering todo items based on their status.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
