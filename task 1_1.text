######  Unveiling the Magic: Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript #######

*** Introduction:

JavaScript, the dynamic and versatile programming language, owes much of its power to the concept of objects. 
Objects serve as the fundamental building blocks, allowing developers to structure and manipulate data in a flexible 
and intuitive manner. In this blog, we'll delve into the fascinating realm of objects and explore their internal 
representation in JavaScript.

*** Objects: The Cornerstone of JavaScript

In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

* Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
* Dates are always objects
* Maths are always objects
* Regular expressions are always objects
* Arrays are always objects
* Functions are always objects
* Objects are always objects

*** Internal Representation of Objects:

1. Properties and Methods:

In JavaScript, objects consist of properties and methods. Properties are variables attached to the object, storing data,
while methods are functions associated with the object, allowing it to perform actions.

2. Prototypes:

JavaScript follows a prototype-based inheritance model. Each object has an internal link to another object called its 
prototype. If a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find it.

3. Memory Allocation:

When an object is created, memory is allocated for it. The internal representation of an object includes a pointer to the 
memory location where the object's data is stored.

4. Dynamic Typing:

JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime. This dynamic nature extends
to objects, allowing for the addition or removal of properties and methods on the fly.

5. Hidden Classes:

JavaScript engines use hidden classes to optimize the performance of objects. These hidden classes define the structure of
an object, and objects with the same hidden class can be processed more efficiently.

*** Creating and Manipulating Objects:

1. Literal Notation:

Objects can be created using literal notation, providing a concise and readable syntax:

const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
  }
};

2. Constructor Function:

Objects can also be created using constructor functions, offering a more reusable way to create multiple instances:

function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.sayHello = function() {
    console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
  };
}

const person = new Person("John", 30);

Conclusion:

Understanding the internal representation of objects in JavaScript is like unraveling the magic behind the language's 
expressive power. Whether you're manipulating the properties of an existing object or creating entirely new instances, 
objects remain a cornerstone of JavaScript development. Embrace the flexibility and dynamic nature of objects, and you'll 
unlock the full potential of this versatile programming language.
