# Getting Started with Shooping cart React App
1.Navbar Component:

Displays the navigation bar with the brand logo, navigation links, and cart button.
The cart button displays the current number of items in the cart.
2.App Component:

Manages the main application state, including the cart count.
Renders the Navbar, Section, and Footer components.
Iterates over the data array to render individual product sections.

3.Section Component:

Displays individual product cards with product details such as name, price, and optional sale badge.
Contains an "Add to Cart" button for each product.
Clicking the "Add to Cart" button increments the cart count by 1.
For items with the "View options" button, clicking does not affect the cart count.

4.Footer Component:

Displays the footer section with copyright information.

5.State Management:

Uses React's useState hook to manage the cart count state.
The cart count state is passed down as a prop to the Navbar and Section components to display the updated count.
Clicking the "Add to Cart" button in the Section component updates the cart count state in the App component, reflecting the changes in the Navbar.

Overall, the app allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and view the total number of items in the cart dynamically.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
